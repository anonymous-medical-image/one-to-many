# Medical Image Transformation Framework

This project implements a framework for generating multiple types of medical images using a single model. The framework includes model architectures located in the `Src/models` directory and pre-trained models stored in the `VQGAN` folder. The data used for training and testing can be sourced from the following datasets:
